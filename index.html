	<li>Dice the garlic and add to the pan once heated, heat for about 30 second to a minute</li>
	<li>Once the garlic has been heated up add in the halved tomatoes</li>
	<li>While the tomatoes are cooking, add your pasta to boiling water and cook to al dente per box</li>
	<li>Cook until the tomatoes have released all their juice</li>

	<li>Add the cooked pasta to the pan with some pasta water</li>
	<li>Mix and enjoy with freshly grated parmesan </li>

<p>This is my favorite recipe as the sauce from fresh tomatoes has a very light taste which I find delicious in the summer months. It is not to overpowering and strong, and is best enjoyed on a nice summer evening with a glass of red wine!</p>
